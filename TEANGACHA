# This file contains ISO-639-1 codes for all supported languages
# (that is, there exist rule sets for checking the
# grammar of texts written in these languages).
#
# The second column contains the default character encoding for documents
# written in the language.  This is also the character encoding used to
# implement all of the ".in" rule files for the language.
#
# The language of the messages seen by the end user doesn't need to be the
# same as the language of the documents being checked.  The former is 
# controlled by GNU gettext, and information about available user interface
# languages can be found in the "po" directory (in particular, "po/LINGUAS").
