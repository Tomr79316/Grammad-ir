<p>
If you just want to install and use the Irish grammar checker, 
you probably don't need to download anything from this site;
instead you should install the Perl module
<i>Lingua::GA::Gramadoir</i> as described below.
</p>

<h2><a name="Devel">Developers</a></h2>

<p>
All developers will need the latest version of
the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114958&package_id=124572">developers' pack</a>, which contains the scripts 
for converting rule sets into an installable Perl module.
</p>

<p>
All of the language-dependent input files used by the developers' pack
(lexicons, rule sets, etc.) are contained in the following
<i>language packs</i>:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114958&package_id=128125">gramadoir-ga</a> (Irish)
</ul>
</p>

<h2><a name="Install">Installation and Usage</a></h2>

<h3>Linux and Mac OS X</h3>

<p>
For Mac OS X, if you don't like installing packages from
the command line, you can buy a standalone version of the
grammar checker called "Ceart", produced in collaboration
with <a href="http://www.cruinneog.com/ceart/">Cruinneog</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Irish grammar checker is distributed as the Perl module
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Lingua-GA-Gramadoir/"><i>Lingua::GA::Gramadoir</i></a>.
If you are using Linux or some other Unix-like 
operating system (including Mac OS X),
you surely already have Perl installed
and you can
<a href="http://www.troubleshooters.com/codecorn/littperl/perlcpan.htm">install the module using <i>CPAN.pm</i></a>, for example, like this:
</p>

<pre>
$ cpan
cpan&gt; install Lingua::GA::Gramadoir
</pre>

<p>
You probably need to have root permission to do this; 
if you don't, or you don't know what this means, ask a system
administrator for help. 
Also, if this is the first time you're running cpan, you'll be
guided through some configuration steps before you can
do the installation.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, you can also install everything by hand:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114958&package_id=125358">download</a> Lingua::GA::Gramadoir,
unpack the archive, and
try the following standard procedure:
</p>
<pre>
% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make install
</pre>

<p>
You should now have the front-end script 
<i>gram-ga.pl</i> installed.  To check the grammar of an
Irish language text file called <i>gaeilge.txt</i>,
use the following from the shell prompt:
</p>
<pre>
% gram-ga.pl gaeilge.txt
</pre>

<p>
More detailed usage instructions can be found using:
</p>
<pre>
% gram-ga.pl --help
</pre>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>
Things are somewhat more painful if you're running something
like <a href="http://www.fainne.org/microbog/">Windows</a>.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Install the latest version of
<a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/">ActiveState Perl</a>.
<li>Go the DOS prompt (for the youngsters, you can get there
by going to Start-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Command Prompt)
<li>Enter "perl -v" to verify that perl was installed correctly and is in your path; you should see something like this:
<pre>
C:&gt; perl -v

This is perl, v.5.8.6 built for MSWin32-x86-multi-thread
(with 3 registered patches, see perl -V for more detail)

<li>Now install <i>An Gramad√≥ir</i> using the ActivePerl package manager
<a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/docs/ActivePerl/faq/ActivePerl-faq2.html">ppm</a>:
<pre>
C:&gt; ppm
ppm&gt; install Lingua::GA::Gramadoir
ppm&gt; quit
</pre>
<li>You should now have the front-end script 
<i>gram-ga.pl</i> installed.  Unfortunately, by default DOS isn't
capable of displaying the ANSI control codes that are
used to highlight the errors in color.  Also, you need to
tell <i lang="ga">An Gramad&oacute;ir</i> to display messages
in the default DOS character encoding (ibm-850).
Therefore, to check an Irish language text file called <i>gaeilge.txt</i>,
use the following:
</p>
<pre>
C:&gt; gram-ga.pl --aschod=cp850 --dath=none gaeilge.txt
</pre>
<p>Addendum (3 April 2012): I'm grateful to Chris Snedigar for pointing out
<a href="http://softkube.com/blog/ansi-command-line-colors-under-windows/">this trick</a> for enabling the ANSI color codes!
