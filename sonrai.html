<h1>An Gramad&oacute;ir:<br>
Architecture and implementation details</h1>

<hr>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The <i>gr</i> front-end script is intended to be used like the
standard Unix "filter" programs upon which it is built: "grep",
"sed", etc.   At its simplest, it reads standard input
and writes the grammatical errors to standard output.   
</p>

<p>
Programs of this type are useful because they can be easily
used as building blocks for more complicated software.
In the same way that <i lang="ga">An Gramad&oacute;ir</i> is built from 
simpler filters, we expect that much more complex natural
language processing applications can be built using
<i lang="ga">An Gramad&oacute;ir</i> and its components.
</p>

<p>
Before we elaborate on this point, it is worth having a look
at the guts of the <i>gr</i> script.   The line which does
all of the real work is simply a sequence of filters:
<pre>
diutf | abairti | cuardach | aonchiall | rialacha | eisceacht | comheadan | loganu
</pre>
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><i>diutf</i></td> 
<td>naively converts utf-8 encoded files to ISO-8859-1 if necessary</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>abairti</i></td>
<td>marks up words; breaks up into one sentence per line</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>cuardach</i></td>
<td>looks up words in the database; adds grammatical tags</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>aonchiall</i></td>
<td>attempts to disambiguate parts of speech from context</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>rialacha</i></td>
<td>searches for and marks up grammatical errors</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>eisceacht</i></td>
<td>strips off error markup from exceptions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>comheadan</i></td>
<td>extracts the error markup and generates the output script</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>loganu</i></td>
<td>localization of the output</td>
</tr>
<tr>
</table>

<p>
Each of the five filters from <i>abairti</i> through <i>eisceacht</i> 
adds or removes some XML markup to or from the text stream. 
An XML-based architecture will, I hope, facilitate the integration 
of these components into
more complicated future software projects.  For instance, the XML file 
created by stopping after <i>cuardach</i>
can be used as a spellchecker (grep out all &lt;X&gt; tags).   
Use one more filter and you have a part-of-speech tagger that can be used
for corpus linguistics or as the first stage of a (conjectural) 
Irish language parser.

<h2>Detailed module descriptions</h2>

<h3><i>abairti</i></h3>
<p>
Coming soon...
</p>
 
<h3><i>cuardach</i></h3>
<p>
This is the only part of the code which uses the dictionary
database <i>focail.bs</i>.  It is (for this reason) the only module
which is written in C.   The database consists of around 300,000 
records, each representing an Irish word, of the form:
</p>
<pre>
agree# tail delimiter inflectionbytes delimiter
</pre>
<p>
Here "agree#" is an integer indicating the number of initial characters
shared by the current and previous word (for compression);
"tail" is the remainder of the word starting at the first character of
disagreement; "delimiter" is a single byte not used for any other
purpose in the database (currently using '\n', ASCII 10); 
"inflectionbytes" is a string of bytes, each representing a possible
grammatical description of the current word.
</p>

<p>
The individual bytes of "inflectionbytes" are bitmasks.   The two
high bits are the main part of speech determiners: 01=noun, 10=adjective,
11=verb, 00=all others.
The remaining six bits have the same meaning for both nouns and adjectives:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Bit 0 (lowest): unused.
<li>Bit 1: word has a prefixed "h"
<li>Bit 2: word is masculine
<li>Bit 3: word has a gender
<li>Bit 4: word is genitive
<li>Bit 5: word is plural
</ul>

<p>
For instance, <i lang="ga">dlúthdhioscaí</i> appears in the database 
with just a single inflection byte, 
value 108=64 (noun) + 32 (plural) + 8 (gender) + 4 (masculine).
</p>

<p>
Verbs use the remaining bits somewhat differently.   The highest remaining
bit (Bit 5 using the scheme above) indicates whether the word is
plural.  The next two indicate "person": 00=autonomous, 01=first, 10=second,
11=third; and the three lowest bits together represent the "tense":
</p>

<ul>
<li>000: imperative
<li>001: present
<li>010: unused
<li>011: past
<li>100: future
<li>101: imperfect
<li>110: conditional
<li>111: subjunctive
</ul>

<p>
Finally, there are the "others" (two highest bits zero).
The lowest bit is unused, and Bit 1 is used to indicate 
a prefixed "h" (for pronouns) or an emphatic form
(for pronomials).
Bits 2 through 5 together determine the part of speech:
</p>
<ul>
<li>0000: unused
<li>0001: unknown
<li>0010: article
<li>0011: preposition
<li>0100: pronoun
<li>0101: pronomial
<li>0110: adverb
<li>0111: conjunction
<li>1000: interrogative
<li>1001: interjection
<li>1010: possessive
<li>1011: proper name
<li>1100-1111: unused
</ul>
<p>
Note that I was careful to avoid the bytes 0 and 10 as allowable
inflection codes since these have other meanings in the database file.

Naturally you're wondering what word form in Irish has the largest
number of possible grammatical interpretations.   Skip to the 
<a href="#answer">bottom of the page</a> for the answer.

<p>
<a name="answer">Answer</a>: <i lang="ga">rua</i> appears 
in the database with thirteen
different inflection bytes.  Several of these are theoretically possible
but improbable subjunctives of <i lang="ga">ruaigh</i>. 
"May you redden..." !
