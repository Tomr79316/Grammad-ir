<p>
This is the home page for <i lang="ga">An Gramad&oacute;ir</i>,
an open source grammar checking engine.  It is intended
as a platform for the development of sophisticated
natural language processing tools for languages with limited
computational resources.
It is currently implemented for the Irish language (Gaeilge);
this is, to the best of my knowledge, the first grammar checker
developed for any minority language.
</p>

<h2><a name="Features">Features</a></h2>
An Gramadóir is:
<ul>
<li><b>Portable</b>.  As of version 0.5 the core engine is 
written entirely in Perl which it means it will run on just about
anything that plugs in.   It has been tested on a variety of
platforms and operating systems:
Linux (x86, ppc, amd64),
*BSD (x86),
Sun Solaris,
DEC alpha,
Mac OSX,
and Windows.
<li><b>Modular</b>.   The Perl module provides separate interfaces
for sentence segmentation, spell checking, part-of-speech tagging,
and grammar checking.   These components provide a platform for the development of applications for much more complex natural language processing tasks
(e.g. parsing, machine translation).
<li><b>Easy to use</b>.  There is a simple command line interface 
that reads text from standard input and writes errors to standard
output (you can see some actual output on
the <a href="sampla.html">Sampler page</a>). 
Or, you can try the software now using the
<a href="foirm.html">Web Interface</a>.
There are also interfaces that allow the grammar checker to
be called from the text editors <a href="eagar.html">emacs and vim</a>
(here is a <a href="gramadoir.png">screenshot</a> of the
vim interface in action). A prototype interface to 
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a> is available as well.
Last but not least, I'm working on a nice standalone GUI
version (with <a href="http://www.cruinneog.com/">Diarmaid Mac Mathúna</a>)
that should be ready before long.
<li><b>Corpus-based</b>.  Various components of the engine can be 
bootstrapped from corpora harvested by my web crawling
software <a href="/crubadan/index.html">An Crúbadán</a>.  This is
essential for languages with severely limited resources, allowing
for rapid development with a minimum of effort.
<li><b>Easy to develop</b>.  I've tried to design the language
developer's pack so that no programming experience is needed.
All Perl code is generated automatically from a number
of (hopefully simple) plain text input files.
This is especially important for minority languages where in 
many cases there is a lack of trained linguists, software
developers, or both.
<li><b>Scalable</b>.    With as little as an hour or two of work (editing
word lists output by my web crawler) a developer can have a decent
spell checking package up and running.   On the other hand, the
engine is flexible enough to allow for full-scale grammar checking
(as evidenced by the sometimes-rococo Irish version).
<li><b>Language independent</b>.   (More or less).  Most open source 
language technology is designed with (Indo-)European languages in mind.
To counter this trend I've included things like full Unicode support and
better support for
the rich morphological phenomena found in many non-European languages.
<li><b>Free Software</b>.  
It is released under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>
which means (roughly speaking) 
that you are free to copy, modify, or even sell this 
software as long as redistributed versions preserve these same freedoms.
Please consider 
<a href="cuidiu.html">contributing</a> to
help improve later releases.

<h2>Installation and Usage</h2>

<p>
First, <a href="sios.html">Download</a> the tarball.
Then (assuming you want to install to /usr/local and you
have the appropriate permissions) 
try the following standard installation process:
</p>
<pre>
% gunzip gramadoir-x.x.tar.gz
% tar xvf gramadoir-x.x.tar
% cd gramadoir-x.x
% ./configure
% make
% make install
% make installcheck
</pre>

<p>
The front-end script is called "gr".   To check the grammar of an
Irish language text file called <i>gaeilge.txt</i>, use the following:
</p>
<pre>
% gr gaeilge.txt
</pre>


<p>
If there are words you would like to be disregarded while checking
spelling and grammar you can place them, one per line, in a plain text file
in your home directory called ".neamhshuim".
</p>

<p>
Here are a few generally useful command line options:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>--litriu</b>: Write all of the unknown/misspelled words to standard output.
<li><b>--aschur=FILE</b>: Write output to FILE.
<li><b>--aspell</b>: Make suggestions for correcting misspellings (requires that <a href="http://aspell.net/">GNU aspell</a> be installed).
<li><b>--iomlan</b>: Report all errors (do not use the file "~/.neamhshuim").
<li><b>--teanga=XX</b>: Specify the two-letter ISO-639-1 code for the language of the text to be checked.  Default is ga (Irish).
<li><b>--ionchod=ENC</b>: Specify the character encoding of the input text.  The default depends on the language; Irish uses ISO88591.
<li><b>--help</b>: Display some help and exit.
<li><b>--version</b>: Display version and copyright information and exit.
</ul>

<p>
And some for use by developers (see the <a href="sonrai.html">Details</a> page
for more information on how to use these options effectively):
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>--api</b>: Output errors in a simple XML format for use with other applications.
<li><b>--brill</b>: Find candidate disambiguation rules using Brill's
unsupervised learning algorithm.
<li><b>--html</b>: Produce HTML output which should resemble the output of vanilla "gr" when viewed in a web browser.  This option is used by the 
<a href="form.html">Web Interface</a>.
<li><b>--ilchiall</b>: Generate a report consisting of all (part of speech)
ambiguities remaining after two passes through the disambiguation module,
sorted by frequency.
<li><b>--minic</b>: List all part of speech tags appearing in the file, sorted
by frequency.  This output can be used for the <i>unigram-xx.txt</i> file.
<li><b>--no-unigram</b>: Do not perform the "last resort" part of speech
disambiguation according to tag frequency.
<li><b>--xml</b>: Write the intermediate tagged XML stream to standard output;
useful for debugging.
</ul>
