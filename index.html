<h2><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h2>

<p>
This is the home page for <i lang="ga">An Gramad&oacute;ir</i>,
an open source grammar checking engine.  It is intended
as a platform for the development of sophisticated
natural language processing tools for languages with limited
computational resources.
It is currently implemented for the Irish language (Gaeilge);
this is, to the best of my knowledge, the first grammar checker
developed for any minority language.

<h2><a name="Features">Features</a></h2>
<i lang="ga">An Gramadóir</i> is:
<ul>
<li><b>Portable</b>.  As of version 0.5 the core engine is 
written entirely in Perl which means it will run on just about
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/ports/index.html">anything that plugs in</a>.
It has been tested on a variety of
platforms and operating systems:
Linux (x86, ppc, amd64),
*BSD (x86),
Sun Solaris,
DEC alpha,
Mac OSX,
and Windows.
<li><b>Modular</b>.   The Perl module provides separate interfaces
for sentence segmentation, spell checking, part-of-speech tagging,
and grammar checking.   These components provide a platform for the development of applications for much more complex natural language processing tasks
(e.g. parsing, machine translation).
<li><b>Easy to use</b>.  There is a simple command line interface 
that reads text from standard input and writes errors to standard
output (you can see some actual output on
the <a href="sampla.html">Sampler page</a>). 
Or, you can try the software now using the
<a href="form.html">Web Interface</a>.
There are also interfaces that allow the grammar checker to
be called from the text editors <a href="eagar.html">emacs, vim, and OpenOffice</a>.
Last but not least, I'm working on a nice standalone GUI
version (with <a href="http://www.cruinneog.com/">Diarmaid Mac Mathúna</a>)
that should be ready before long.
<li><b>Corpus-based</b>.  Various components of the engine can be 
bootstrapped from corpora harvested by my web crawling
software <a href="/crubadan/index.html">An Crúbadán</a>.  This is
essential for languages with severely limited resources, allowing 
rapid development with a minimum of effort.
<li><b>Easy to develop</b>.  I've tried to design the language
developers' pack so that no programming experience is needed.
All Perl code is generated automatically from a number
of (hopefully simple) plain text input files.
This is especially important for minority languages where in 
many cases there is a lack of trained linguists, software
developers, or both.
<li><b>Scalable</b>.    With as little as an hour or two of work (editing
word lists output by my web crawler) a developer can have a decent
spell checking package up and running.   On the other hand, the
engine is flexible enough to allow for full-scale grammar checking
(as evidenced by the rococo Irish version).
<li><b>Language independent</b>.   (More or less).  Most open source 
language technology is designed with (Indo-)European languages in mind.
To counter this trend I've included things like full Unicode support and
better support for
the rich morphological phenomena found in many non-European languages.
<li><b>Free Software</b>.  
It is released under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>
which means (roughly speaking) 
that you are free to copy, modify, or even sell this 
software as long as redistributed versions preserve these same freedoms.
Please consider 
<a href="cuidiu.html">contributing</a> to
help improve later releases.

<h2><a name="Install">Installation and Usage</a></h2>

<p>
The Irish grammar checker is distributed as the Perl module
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Lingua-GA-Gramadoir/"><i>Lingua::GA::Gramadoir</i></a>.
If you are using Linux or some other Unix-like 
operating system, you surely already have Perl installed
and you can
<a href="http://www.troubleshooters.com/codecorn/littperl/perlcpan.htm">install the module using <i>CPAN.pm</i></a>.
If you are running something primitive like 
<a href="http://www.fainne.org/microbog/">Windows</a>,
you'll first have to install
<a href="http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/">ActiveState Perl</a>
and then install <i>An Gramadóir</i> using
<a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/docs/ActivePerl/faq/ActivePerl-faq2.html">ppm</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can also install manually:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114958&package_id=125358">download</a>,
unpack the archive, and
try the following standard procedure:
</p>
<pre>
% perl Makefile.PL
% make
% make install
</pre>

<p>
You should then have the front-end script 
<i>gram-ga.pl</i> installed.  To check the grammar of an
Irish language text file called <i>gaeilge.txt</i>,
use the following from the command line:
</p>
<pre>
% gram-ga.pl gaeilge.txt
</pre>

<p>
More detailed usage instructions can be found here.
