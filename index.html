<h2><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h2>

<p>
This is the home page for <i lang="ga">An Gramad&oacute;ir</i>,
the first grammar and style checker for the Irish language.
In fact, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first
such package for any minority language.
</p>

<p>
You are welcome to <a href="sios.html">download</a> the software
for free from this site.  It is released under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>
which means (roughly speaking) 
that you are free to copy, modify, or even sell this 
software as long as redistributed versions preserve these same freedoms.
Please consider 
<a href="cuidiu.html">contributing</a> your own rules to
help improve later releases.
</p>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p>
This is software for Unix and Linux platforms.
If you are an Irish speaker and are using, say, Windows, 
you should format your hard drive and install something
like <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo Linux</a>.
It's free and the grassroots
<a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/po/HTML/team-ga.html">translation of GNU/Linux into Irish</a> is well underway.
Otherwise, have fun waiting for Microsoft to release 
<a href="http://www.fainne.org/microbog/">Windows in Irish</a>.
</p>

<p>
There are (intentionally) very few software dependencies for this package. 
Everything you need should come pre-loaded with any self-respecting
Linux distribution: <i>bash</i>, 
<i>sed</i>, <i>awk</i>, <i>perl</i>,
<i>grep</i>, and a C compiler.  Users interested in
<a href="cuidiu.html">contributing</a> rules will probably also want
<i>flex</i> and <i>bison</i>.
There is no <i>a priori</i> reason why you shouldn't be able to
get things working with Mac OS X if you've built the GNU versions
of the programs above, but I haven't tried it yet.
</p>

<h2>Installation and Usage</h2>

<p>
First, <a href="sios.html">Download</a> the tarball.
Then (assuming you want to install to /usr/local and you
have the appropriate permissions) 
try the following standard installation process:
</p>
<pre>
% gunzip gramadoir-x.x.tar.gz
% tar xvf gramadoir-x.x.tar
% cd gramadoir-x.x
% ./configure
% make
% make install
% make installcheck
</pre>

<p>
The front-end script is called "gr".   To check the grammar of an
Irish language text file called <i>gaeilge.txt</i>, use the following:
</p>
<pre>
% gr gaeilge.txt
</pre>

<p>
Each sentence containing an error is written to standard output.
The sentence is preceded by the line number (in the original text file)
on which it starts and is followed by a brief description of the errors
found in the sentence.   You can see some actual output on
the <a href="sampla.html">Sampler page</a>.
