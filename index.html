<h2><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h2>

<p>
This is the home page for <i lang="ga">An Gramad&oacute;ir</i>,
the first grammar and style checker for the Irish language.
In fact, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first
such package for any minority language.
</p>

<p>
You are welcome to <a href="sios.html">download</a> the software
for free from this site.  It is released under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>
which means (roughly speaking) 
that you are free to copy, modify, or even sell this 
software as long as redistributed versions preserve these same freedoms.
Please consider 
<a href="cuidiu.html">contributing</a> your own rules to
help improve later releases.
</p>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p>
This is software for Unix and Linux platforms.
If you are an Irish speaker and are using, say, Windows, 
you should format your hard drive and install something
like <a href="http://www.gentoo.org">Gentoo Linux</a>.
It's free and the grassroots
<a href="/gnu/index.html">translation of GNU/Linux into Irish</a> is well underway.
Otherwise, have fun waiting for Microsoft to release 
<a href="http://www.fainne.org/microbog/">Windows in Irish</a>.
</p>

<p>
There are (intentionally) very few software dependencies for this package. 
Everything you need should come pre-loaded with any self-respecting
Linux distribution: <i>bash</i>, 
<i>sed</i>, <i>awk</i>, <i>perl</i>,
<i>grep</i>, and a C compiler.  Users interested in
<a href="cuidiu.html">contributing</a> rules will probably also want
<i>flex</i> and <i>bison</i>.
I have managed to build and test everything under Gentoo Linux,
Solaris 8, and on a DEC alpha.
There is no <i>a priori</i> reason why you shouldn't be able to
get things working with Mac OS X if you have built
the programs above, but I haven't tried it yet.

<h2>Installation and Usage</h2>

<p>
First, <a href="sios.html">Download</a> the tarball.
Then (assuming you want to install to /usr/local and you
have the appropriate permissions) 
try the following standard installation process:
</p>
<pre>
% gunzip gramadoir-x.x.tar.gz
% tar xvf gramadoir-x.x.tar
% cd gramadoir-x.x
% ./configure
% make
% make install
% make installcheck
</pre>

<p>
The front-end script is called "gr".   To check the grammar of an
Irish language text file called <i>gaeilge.txt</i>, use the following:
</p>
<pre>
% gr gaeilge.txt
</pre>

<p>
Each sentence containing an error is written to standard output.
The sentence is preceded by the line number (in the original text file)
on which it starts and is followed by a brief description of the errors
found in the sentence.   You can see some actual output on
the <a href="sampla.html">Sampler page</a>, or enter some of your own text into
the <a href="foirm.html">Web Interface</a>.
</p>

<p>
If there are words you would like to be disregarded while checking
spelling and grammar you can create a plain text file in your home directory 
called ".neamhshuim".  The first line should contain the number of
words in the file and then place one word on each line.
</p>

<p>
There are also a few command line options:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>--litriu</b>: Write all of the unknown/misspelled words to standard output.
<li><b>--html</b>: Produce HTML output which should resemble the output of vanilla "gr" when viewed in a web browser.
<li><b>--xml</b>: Write the intermediate tagged XML stream to standard output;
useful for debugging.
<li><b>--iomlan</b>: Report all errors (do not use the file "~/.neamhshuim").
<li><b>--teanga=XX</b>: Specify the two-letter ISO-639-1 code for the language of the text to be checked.  Default is ga (Irish).
<li><b>--ionchod=ENC</b>: Specify the character encoding of the input text.  The default depends on the language; Irish uses ISO88591.
<li><b>--help</b>: Display some help and exit.
<li><b>--version</b>: Display version and copyright information and exit.
</ul>
