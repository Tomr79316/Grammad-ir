<h1>An Gramad&oacute;ir:<br>
How to Contribute</h1>

<h2>Contributing words</h2>
The database of Irish words used by <i>An Gramad&oacute;ir</i>
is the same one used by my other Irish language applications:
the 
<a href="/ispell/index.html">GaelSpell</a> spellchecker
and <a href="/teasaras/index.html">An Teas&aacute;ras Leictreonach</a>.
Thus, if you take the time to contribute new words to any one of 
these packages, your contributions will be reflected in future 
releases of all of them.  Also, my software adds all inflections
and mutations of a given word to the database, so you don't have 
to worry about <i lang="ga">nGaeltacht, Ghaeltacht, Gaeltachta</i>,
etc. once the headword <i lang="ga">Gaeltacht</i> has been entered.

<h2>Hacking the rule set</h2>
<p>
The easiest and most valuable way to contribute is by
helping add new rules to the checker.   Rules are contained in
two plain text files called <i>aonchiall.in</i> and <i>rialacha.in</i>.
Complicated "meta"-scripts convert these (somewhat) human-readable
files into the scripts which actually find and mark up the grammatical
errors.   You 
fortunately don't need to understand this process to contribute rules
(although anyone who is curious can read the  
<a href="sonrai.html">Details</a> page).
</p>

<p>
The file <i>aonchiall.in</i> contains rules for disambiguating 
parts of speech; for instance, the word <i>an</i> in Irish can either be
the definite article or an interrogative particle.   The first
couple of lines of <i>aonchiall.in</i> are rules which indicate
that if <i>an</i> is followed by a verb, we expect it to be
an interrogative and otherwise it is the article. 
This kind of disambiguation is obviously a necessary preliminary step 
before one
can try to apply grammatical rules depending on part of speech.
</p>

<p>
The file <i>rialacha.in</i> contains the grammatical rules proper.
The sections which follow describe the structure of these files
in sufficient detail that (I hope) you will be able to write
and contribute your own rules for inclusion in later releases.
Alternatively, if you provide me with a brief description 
(in plain English or Irish) of
a rule you think is missing from the database, I will try and
construct the appropriate entry.
