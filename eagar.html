<h1>An Gramad&oacute;ir:<br>
Text Editors</h1>

<hr>
<h2>Emacs</h2>
<p>
Martin Gregory has kindly contributed an Emacs interface 
to <i lang="ga">An Gramadóir</i> which is very easy to use.  It shows you
a split screen with the original text file on top and the 
errors output by <i lang="ga">An Gramadóir</i> below.  With a single keystroke,
you can move through the errors in parallel, making corrections as 
you go.  Here are his instructions (the file <i>gramadoir.el</i> is
included in the distribution as of version 0.3):
</p>

<p>
"If you are an experienced Emacs user, you'll
probably want to auto load the file and define your own keys for the
two functions listed below.
</p>

<ol>
<li>put <i>gramadoir.el</i> in your emacs site lisp directory, if you don't
have one, put it it ~/lisp

<li>put the following lines in your ~/.emacs file
<pre>
   (load-file "~/lisp/gramadoir.el")
   (global-set-key "\C-cg" 'gramadoir-check-files)
   (global-set-key [f3] 'gramadoir-next-message)
</pre>

<li>start Emacs

<li>To have <i lang="ga">An Gramadóir</i> check files, press the key ^C followed by the key g. 

<li>You are prompted for files to check, enter them using either
relative or absolute paths, but avoid using ~ or environment
variables as <i>gramadoir.el</i> doesn't handle these yet.

<li>A second window will open with the messages from gr.

<li>To go to the first error position in the first file, press
F3. Repeated pressing of F3 takes you to each subsequent error."
</ol>

<hr>
<h2>Vim</h2>
<p>
I've written a script which emulates the behavior of Martin's
Emacs interface within Vim.  It will be included in future 
distributions, or you can download it directly from
<a href="http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=802">
Vim online</a>.     Instructions:
<ol>
<li>put <i>gramadoir.vim</i> in ~/.vim/plugin.

<li>put the following lines in your ~/.vimrc file
<pre>
map &lt;F3&gt; &lt;Gr&gt;
map &lt;F4&gt; &lt;Amach&gt;
</pre>
or choose different hot keys if you want.

<li>open an Irish language text file in Vim.

<li>to check its grammar, press F3; a second window will open with 
the messages from <i lang="ga">An Gramadóir</i>.  The cursor
will move to the first error (which is also highlighted in red if you
are using a suitable color terminal).

<li>Each successive use of F3 moves to the next error
(in both windows, in parallel).

<li>Pressing F4 exits the grammar checker and resumes normal editing.
</ol>
