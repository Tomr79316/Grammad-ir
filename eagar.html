<h1>An Gramad&oacute;ir:<br>
Text Editor Support</h1>

<h2>Download</h2>
<p>
Interfaces are available for the three most popular editors 
in the open source community: <i>Vim</i>, <i>Emacs</i>, and 
<i>OpenOffice</i>.  These interfaces are distributed with the Perl
module in the <i>share/</i> directory, but if you prefer you
can download them here:
</p>

<ul>

<li><b><a href="gramadoir.vim">gramadoir.vim</a></b>.  Plug-in for Vim (<a href="gram-vim.png">screenshot</a>).
<li><b><a href="gramadoir.sxw">gramadoir.sxw</a></b>.  OpenOffice macro (<a href="gram-OOo.png">screenshot</a>).
</ul>

Installation and usage instructions follow.

<h2>Emacs</h2>
<p>
Martin Gregory has kindly contributed an Emacs interface 
to <i lang="ga">An Gramadóir</i> which is very easy to use.
Here are his instructions:
</p>


<p>
"The Emacs interface to <i lang="ga">An Gramadóir</i> allows you to run <i lang="ga">An Gramadóir</i>
from within an Emacs session and navigate to the locations in the
input files where <i lang="ga">An Gramadóir</i> found problems. The interface is
similar to that of the compile or grep commands in Emacs.
</p>


<h3>INSTALLING THE INTERFACE:</h3>

<p>
Put gramadoir.el in your emacs site lisp directory, often something like:
<pre>
   /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp/gramadoir
</pre>
If you don't have
one, put it it ~/lisp or some other directory of your choice and put
the following line in your ~/.emacs file<br>
<pre>
   (load-file "/where/you/put/gramadoir.el")
</pre>
If you are an experienced Emacs user, you'll probably want to auto
load the file.
</p>


<h3>USING THE INTERFACE:</h3>

<p>
The interface allows you to specify files in two different ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>using the command gramadoir-check-files which prompts for a space
separated list of files, without file completion;
<li>from a dired window using the gramadoir-dired command. This behaves
like other dired commands: either all selected files are processed
or, if no file is selected, the file listed on the current
line is processed.
</ul>

<p>
After running one of the above commands, the output of <i lang="ga">An Gramadóir</i> is
written to a new buffer which is displayed in a separate window. Using
the gramadoir-next-message command positions the cursor at the
location of the first error in the first file. Subsequent use of this
command takes you to the locations of subsequent errors. If you
reposition the cursor in the output buffer, the command takes you to
the location of the next error after that position.
</p>


<h3>CUSTOMISATION:</h3>

<p>
For convenience, you can bind the three commands to keys. These need
to be global definitions, for example:
</p>

<pre>
   (global-set-key "\C-cg" 'gramadoir-check-files)
   (global-set-key "\C-cd" 'gramadoir-dired)
   (global-set-key [f3] 'gramadoir-next-message)
</pre>


<p>
If you installed <i lang="ga">An Gramadóir</i> anywhere other than in /usr/bin
you need to tell the interface where to look for it by putting a line
similar to the following:<br>
<pre>
   (setq gramadoir-program-path "/usr/bin/gram-xx.pl")
</pre>
in your ~/.emacs, substituting the appropriate path for "/usr/bin"
and language code for "xx".
</p>

<p>
Finally, the interface highlights the error text both in the output
buffer and in the buffer of the original file. If you prefer not to
highlight the text in the original file, add this:<br>
<pre>
   (setq gramadoir-highlight-text nil)
</pre>
to your ~/.emacs."
</p>

<h2>Vim</h2>
<p>
I've written a script which emulates the behavior of Martin's
Emacs interface within Vim.  You can download it from the link at the
top of this page, or you can get it directly from
<a href="http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=802">
Vim online</a>.     Instructions:
<ol>
<li>put <i>gramadoir.vim</i> in ~/.vim/plugin.  For languages other
than Irish, you'll need to change the "gram-ga.pl" around line 30 to
the appropriate script name.

<li>put the following lines in your ~/.vimrc file
<pre>
map &lt;F3&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;Gr
map &lt;F4&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;Neamh
map &lt;F5&gt; &lt;Plug&gt;Amach
</pre>
or choose different hot keys if you want.

<li>open the text file to be checked in Vim.

<li>to check its grammar, press <b>F3</b>; a second buffer,
containing the messages from <i lang="ga">An Gramadóir</i>,
will open at the bottom of the screen.  The cursor
will move to the first error (which is also highlighted in red if you
are using a suitable color terminal).

<li>Each successive use of <b>F3</b> moves to the next error
(in both windows, in parallel).

<li>If the current error is a single word (unknown, misspelled, rare,
non-standard, etc.), you can insert it into your <code>.neamhshuim</code> 
(ignore) file by pressing <b>F4</b>.

<li>Pressing <b>F5</b> exits the grammar checker and resumes normal editing.

<li>Notes: you are free to make edits, corrections, etc. to the 
main buffer while running the grammar checker.  The last error
displayed is tracked according to the cursor position in the 
error buffer, so whenever you press <b>F3</b> it will correctly take you 
to the next error.  This also means that you can jump to any
particular error you'd like: go into the error buffer (with Crtl-w-w),
move the cursor to just before the desired error, press <b>F3</b>.
</ol>

<h2>OpenOffice</h2>
<p>
The file <i>gramadoir.sxw</i> is an OpenOffice document 
that contains an embedded macro allowing <i lang="ga">An Gramadóir</i>
to be called directly from an OpenOffice session.  See Russ Phillips'
<a href="http://www.ooomacros.org/dev.php#98392">Macro Library How-To</a>
for more detailed installation instructions.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Open <i>gramadoir.sxw</i> in OpenOffice.
<li>Go to <b>Tools</b> and select <b>Macros</b>, then <b>Macro...</b>.
<li>The "Macro" dialog will appear.  Double click "Gramadoir" and then
single click the "Gramadoir" underneath.
<li>Now click the <b>Edit</b> button, which will open up the macro
source code.  The first line points to the file <i>groo-ga.bat</i>;
change the "ga" to your ISO-639 language code (if you don't speak Irish),
and change the file extension "bat" to "pl"
if you're not running Windows.
<li>Close the source code window, which should take you back to the 
original file.  Now reopen the "Macro" dialog as in step 2; this time
click on the <b>Organizer</b> button.
<li>The "Macro Organizer" dialog will appear.  Click on the <b>Libraries</b> tab at the top left.
<li>Be sure "soffice" appears under "Application/Document", then click <b>Append</b>.
<li>Choose <i>gramadoir.sxw</i> using the file selection dialog that opens.
<li>Make sure only "Gramadoir" is checked in the "Append Libraries"
dialog; you may need to uncheck "Standard".   Then click <b>OK</b>.
<li>Close the Macro Organizer and then close the Macro dialog.
</ol>

<p>
You should now have the macro installed and ready to use from any
OpenOffice session.   You can associate a hot key or a toolbar item 
with the macro via the <b>Tools-&gt;Configure</b> dialog.
