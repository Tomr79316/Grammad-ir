#  HOW TO PROCESS THE OUTPUT:
# (1)  If the word and all of its inflections are used ONLY as alternates,
#   then it would be desirable to remove the word from the spellcheckers too,
#   therefore it needs to be labelled OD77b in IG.
#   An example is "conach" which is in OD as "hawkmoth" but in the corpus
#   is almost always an alternate of "confadh"
#    If the word is common enough, it might be worth adding a rule
#   like  "g?ch?onach:IONADAI{confadh}" to rialacha, just for the 
#   clearer error message (else just get "correct but very uncommon")
# (2)  If just some inflections are primarily alternates 
#   (like "pill" which is almost always an alt. of "fill", not
#    the genitive of "peall", which is harmless enough on its own)
#    then the dangerous inflections need to be sedded to code 127
# (3) a slightly weaker option exists if the word is sometimes an
#    alternate, sometimes not, depending on context:  in this case,
#   don't change it to 127, but put IONADAI rules in that depend on
#   context.  For example "fail" is common enough, but after "ag/ar/le" 
#   it is surely supposed to be "f치il".   Same with "gabhail".
#    Shouldn't have these without <F> and without context!
# (4) In rare cases an IONADAI error (correct but usually in place of X)
#    can be strengthened to CAIGHDEAN (non-standard form of X) when
#   it is, first of all, totally clear that the non-standard form
#   is intended, and when the info that the word happens to be
#   correct is irrelevant/obvious  (e.g. "i bhfos" -> "abhus",
#    who cares that "fos" is a word?  and in "Dh치+ECLIPSEDVERB" -> "D치",
#    no one needs to be told that "dh치" is actually a correct word!)
