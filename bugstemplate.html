<h2>Reporting bugs</h2>
<p>There are inherent limitations to the approach 
<i>An Gramad√≥ir</i> takes to grammar checking, and because
of this there are errors (involving semantics) it is unlikely ever to catch.
On the other hand, if you've looked through some of the known issues below
and you think you've found something new, feel free to
submit a bug report, support request, or a patch via the
<a href="https://github.com/kscanne/gramadoir/issues">Github issue tracker</a>.  Or just send me an email: kscanne at gmail dot com.</p>
