<h1>An Gramad&oacute;ir:<br>
Porting to other languages</h1>

<hr>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
I would be excited to help port this software
for use with languages other than Irish.  Getting 
something simple up and running should be easy,
even if your language lacks some of the basic tools for
doing natural language processing.  If, however, you 
already have things like a large word list or a
part-of-speech tagger,
then you should be able to begin implementing 
sophisticated grammatical rules immediately.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Things to do</h2>
<p>
<b>1. Build focail.bs</b>.   This is the database of recognized words.
If you have some grammatical rules that
don't require part of speech information, then in fact this step
is optional.  You can either construct <i>focail.bs</i> from a plain text file
containing one word per line (like you will find distributed with
GNU <i>aspell</i> if your language has 
<a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/aspell/dict/index.html"><i>aspell</i> support</a>):<br><br>
<samp>
cat aspell.txt | sed 's/.*/&amp; 1/' | cabhair > focail.bs
</samp>
<br><br>
or get rid of the first rule in <i>rialacha.in</i> to turn off
spellchecking if you have no word list at all.
An intermediate possibility would be if, for instance, you want 
to check for erroneous
constructions like the English 
"He done went fishing", or "He done ate his dinner"
(sadly common in my part of the world).
You could add a rule to <i>rialacha.in</i> resembling:<br><br>
<samp>
&lt;N&gt; done &lt;VP&gt;ANYTHING&lt;/VP&gt;:MESSAGE
</samp>
<br><br>
and populate <i>focail.bs</i> with verbs in the past tense.
It all depends on what kind of checks you need to do for your language.
</p>

<p>
<b>2. Rewrite "byte_to_markup" in cuardach.c</b>.
You can choose the grammatical codes that go into <i>focail.bs</i>
as you see fit;
just decode them correctly in this one function.
</p>

<p>
<b>3. Tweak the details</b>.
If your language has unusual conventions for ends of sentences,
you may need to play with the <i>abairti</i> module.  Or if
you need characters outside of Latin-1, the <i>di-utf</i> 
function will need to be generalized.  The buffers in <i>cuardach.c</i>
for storing Irish words are 32 bytes long
(longest word: <i>ngearr-chlóscríobhneoireachta</i>, 28 bytes) and
may need to be increased.  There may be other minor
things as well.
</p>

<p>
<b>4. Write <i>aonchiall.in</i></b>.  These are the rules for disambiguation.
In Irish, and I would imagine in many other languages, one can get
away without too many rules here.  See
the description of this file on the <a href="cuidiu.html">Contributing</a>
page.
</p>

<p>
<b>5. Write <i>rialacha.in</i> and <i>eisceacht.in</i></b>.  
These are the grammatical rules and exceptions.
Again see the <a href="cuidiu.html">Contributing</a> page for information
on how to create these files.

<p>
<b>6. Localize message strings</b>.
Technically this is part of porting the user interface, not
porting the grammar checker.  I'm guessing however that you'll want to
see the output in the same language as
the documents that are being
checked.  I've kept these strings together at the top of <i>gr.in</i>.
I'll move to using <i>gettext</i> in the future to streamline this.
